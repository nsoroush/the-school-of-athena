Our story begins long ago — in ancient Greece, ancient Rome —  
and with a man whose name still echoes through history: **Julius Caesar**.

> *“If he had anything confidential to say,  
> he wrote it in cipher —  
> that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet,  
> that not a word could be made out.  
> If anyone wishes to decipher these and get at their meaning,  
> he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others.”*  
> — *Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar*

Although Caesar met a tragic end on the Ides of March in 44 BC,  
the cryptographic adventure he helped spark was only just beginning.

In this book, we follow that journey —  
from ancient ciphers and clever puzzles,  
to the mathematical foundations that power **modern cryptography**.

We'll explore how information can be **concealed**, **transformed**, and **secured**,  
how secrets can be **shared**, and how messages can be **protected** — even in the presence of adversaries.

This is a story of logic, language, and locks that can’t be picked.  
Of codes and ciphers, of secrecy and structure.  
It’s a **codex** of cryptography — and you’re invited in.

Let’s begin.
