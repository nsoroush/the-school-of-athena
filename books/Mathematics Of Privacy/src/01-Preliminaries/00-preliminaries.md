## Preliminaries: Your Ticket to the Crypto Cosmos

Welcome to the launchpad of this book! This chapter is all about gearing up—think of it as your treasure map to the mathematical wonders we'll explore together. We're digging into the good stuff: set theory, number theory, a dash of probability, and maybe a few surprises along the way.

First, we'll roll out the essentials—think notations and core concepts that are the secret sauce behind modern cryptography. Then, we'll level up, plunging into the wild worlds of group theory, modular arithmetic, finite fields, and elliptic curves—oh, and more where that came from!
